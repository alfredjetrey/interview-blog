        <li>2.) What actually happen is if client given a request the server will handle that request.
        and your webserver will create two object the request obj and the response obj.
        based on the request normally it is a url it will identify a particular webapplication that needs to run based on the context.root
        after it identify the specific webapp it goes to the web.xml/annotation that have been configured it will identify w/c servlet to run.
        after it identify the servlet the two object that has created will be passed to the servlet and get the request parameter of the request obj.
        then servlet does the processing and pass the result to the response obj.it will generated and html code and this code will go to the reponse obj.
        and your app server will handle the request and gives the response to the browser.</li>
