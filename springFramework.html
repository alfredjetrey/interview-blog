    <ul>1.) Explain to me IOC? Benefits of IOC?</b>
           <li>Intro
              <ul>In traditional programming, the flow of the business logic is determined by objects that are statically assigned to one another.</ul>
              <ul>With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is instantiated by the assembler and is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.</ul>
              <ul>The binding process is achieved through dependency injection, although some argue that the use of a service locator also provides inversion of control.</ul>
           </li>
           <li>Design guidelines
              <ul>1.) There is a decoupling of the execution of a certain task from implementation.</ul>
              <ul>2.) Every module can focus on what it is designed for.</ul>
              <ul>3.) Modules make no assumptions about what other systems do but rely on their contracts.</ul>
              <ul>4.) Replacing modules has no side effect on other modules.</ul>
           </li>
           <li>Differentiating with dependency injection
               <ul><b>IOC</b> Is a design paradigm with the goal of giving more control to the targeted components of your application, the ones getting the work done.</ul>
               <ul><b>DI</b> Is a pattern used to create instances of objects that other objects rely on without knowing at compile time which class will be used to provide that functionality.</ul>
               <ul>Inversion of control relies on dependency injection because a mechanism is needed in order to activate the components providing the specific functionality.
The two concepts work together in this way to allow for much more flexible, reusable, and encapsulated code to be written. As such, they are important concepts in designing object-oriented solutions.</ul>
           </li>
           <li>Implementing IOC
               <ul>1.)Using a factory pattern</ul>
               <ul>2.)Using a service locator pattern</ul>
               <ul>3.)Using a DI of any given below tyep:
                   <li>a constructor injection</li>
                   <li>a setter injection</li>
                   <li>an interface injection </li>
               </ul>
           </li>
           <li>Benefits of using IOC
               <ul>Makes it easier to test your code.Without it , the code you are testing is hard to isolate as it will be highly coupled to the rest of the system</ul>
               <ul>Useful when developing modular systems. You can replace components without requiring recompilation</ul> 
           </li>
           <li>Do you take IOC to production or is it only for Testing?
                <ul>Certainly use it on production as well as for testing.</ul>
           </li>
           <li>Problems it try to solve
               <ul>a.) Decoupling components and layers in the system</ul>
               <ul>b.) Alleviates a component from being responsible for managing it's dependencies</ul>
               <ul>c.) Swap dependency implementations in different environments.</ul>
               <ul>d.) Allows a component be tested through mocking of dependencies.</ul>
               <ul>e.) Provides a mechanism for sharing resources throughout an application.</ul>

    </ul>
    <ul> What is SpringMVC?Explain to me the flow of SpringMVC?
        <li>SpringMVC is designed aroung a DispatcherSevlet that dispathches requests to handlers, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution,locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files.</li>
        <li>Spring clear separation of roles - controller, validator, command object, form object, model object, DispatcherServlet, handler mapping, view resolver, and so on - can be fulfilled by a specialized object.</li>
